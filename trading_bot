Building a trading bot for the automotive industry involves several complex components, including data collection, analysis, and execution of trades. While I can provide you with a basic structure for such a trading bot, please note that creating a fully functional trading bot requires expertise in trading strategies, market analysis, and API integration. Here's a simple example to get you started:

python

import time
import random

class AutomotiveTradingBot:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize necessary variables and connections
        self.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
        self.api_secret = "YOUR_API_SECRET"
        self.base_url = "https://api.example.com"  # Replace with the actual API URL

    def collect_data(self):
        # Implement code to collect relevant data (e.g., market prices, news, sentiment analysis)
        # This can involve web scraping, API calls, or connecting to data providers

        # Example: Randomly generate market prices for demonstration purposes
        current_price = random.uniform(10000, 20000)
        return current_price

    def analyze_data(self, price):
        # Implement code to analyze collected data and make trading decisions
        # This can involve technical analysis, machine learning, or other strategies

        # Example: Make a random trading decision based on the current price
        if price > 15000:
            return "SELL"
        elif price < 12000:
            return "BUY"
        else:
            return "HOLD"

    def execute_trade(self, decision):
        # Implement code to execute trades based on the trading decision
        # This involves connecting to a trading platform API and placing orders

        # Example: Print the trading decision for demonstration purposes
        print(f"Trading decision: {decision}")

    def run(self):
        # Main loop to run the trading bot
        while True:
            price = self.collect_data()
            decision = self.analyze_data(price)
            self.execute_trade(decision)

            # Sleep for a certain duration before the next iteration
            time.sleep(60)  # Adjust the sleep duration as per your requirements


# Instantiate the trading bot and run it
bot = AutomotiveTradingBot()
bot.run()

Please note that this code is a simplified example and may not be suitable for real-world trading without further modifications. Additionally, you would need to replace the placeholder values, such as YOUR_API_KEY, YOUR_API_SECRET, and the API URL, with the appropriate values from your chosen trading platform.

It is strongly recommended to thoroughly test and validate any trading strategies before deploying them with real money. Additionally, consult official documentation and seek professional advice when dealing with real financial data and executing trades.
